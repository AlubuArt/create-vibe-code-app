npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your application.

## AI-Driven Development

This project is configured for seamless AI-assisted development:

1. **📋 Check `project-plan.md`** - Your structured development backlog
2. **🤖 AI Configuration** - `.cursor/rules/project-guide.mdc` guides AI assistants  
3. **🎯 Task-based Development** - Work through tasks sequentially
4. **✅ Progress Tracking** - Mark completed tasks in project-plan.md

### Using with Cursor or AI Assistants

- Open the project in Cursor or your preferred AI-enabled editor
- AI assistants will automatically read the rules from `.cursor/rules/`
- Ask your AI to read `project-plan.md` and start implementing tasks
- AI will follow the structured plan and coding standards
